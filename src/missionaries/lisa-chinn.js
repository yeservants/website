<b>About</b>
Lisa Espineli Chinn served from 2000-2014 as the National Director of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship's International Student Ministry Department. Lisa now continues to serve part-time (unsalaried) with IVCF as a "Ministry Coach/Mentor" but primarily as a missionary at large via YES Inc. Lisa's roles include Bible teaching, mentoring and cross-cultural training of missionaries, preparing international students for "reentry" to their homeland for growth and service, ministry among Filipinos residing abroad, and expanding the international student ministry movement globally and in North America. YES Inc allows Lisa to have greater flexibility in serving the broader Body of Christ and respond to a wider range of invitations to minister globally.
