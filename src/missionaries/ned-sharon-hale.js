<b>About</b>
Ned was on InterVarsity Christian Fellowship campus staff from 1962-2006, and was the National Director of InterVarsity’s “International Student Ministries” (ISM) from 1981-2000. Ned was also one of the founding fathers starting in 1981 of ACMI, the national Association of Christians Ministering among Internationals. From 1988-2000 Ned Directed the post-Urbana Conference for Christian International Students attended by 500-800 Christian internationals from 70-80 countries of the world. He has directed and spoken at many evangelistic, holiday conferences for international students of every ethnicity and nationality. He has also spoken at annual ACMI conferences, which draw Christians involved in ISM from all over North America. In 2006 Ned joined hands with New College Madison and other church and parachurch groups to celebrate the 200th Anniversary of the Haystack Prayer Meeting (held at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1806), which was the seedbed for the launching of the modern Protestant missionary movement in North America. From 2003 to 2012 he was on part-time staff with ACMI where he was responsible for developing ACMI’s “Ministry Resources” for their website and conference seminars, and did research on special projects. Both Ned and Sharon have been elders at Christ Presbyterian Church in Madison, Wisconsin where they lived from 1973 to 2017. Sharon has been a counseling therapist since receiving her master’s degree in counseling and psychotherapy in 1984 and more recently has developed a ministry of “spiritual direction.” In recent years she has made short-term mission trips to Nigeria where she has taught missionaries and worked in homes and schools for disadvantaged youth. They are continuing these various cross-cultural and mission ministries now in their new home base in Evanston, IL as continuing YES missionaries.

<b>Ministry</b>
Ned and Sharon Hale are now involved in cross-cultural mission through First Presbyterian Church of Evanston, IL They are currently developing a personal and church outreach ministry to international students at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Ned is partnering with various ministries in Evanston, including InterVarsity’s graduate fellowship and the Reformed University Fellowship’s outreach to international students at Northwestern University. First Presbyterian Church is initiating a new program of host family outreach to internationals starting in the fall 2017. Sharon joins Ned in many of the above ministries at both personal levels and in serving as a discussion leader in the adult education-in-mission programs of the church. Ned carries on the tradition of the “Haystack” missions conference by leading a monthly book discussion on cutting edge missiological books focused on “Missions history/theology,” (including members who join by Skype each month from some countries in Europe. Since 2006 Ned has been volunteering as the National Archivist for InterVarsity. This ministry has involved essentially “preserving the memories of our peoples,” Ned currently spends time collecting historical materials and depositing these with the Billy Graham Center Archives in Wheaton, Illinois. He gives “whole-life” interviews to prominent figures in InterVarsity from past decades. Much of this interviewing work is also done via Skype to reduce travel expenses nationally and internationally. Currently he has logged over 100 interviews of 1-5 hours in length, and has plans to do hundreds more in coming years. Sharon has developed her counseling skills and has a full load of clients. She also has a continuing interest in Nigeria where she grew up as a missionary’s daughter, and has made two trips back to Jos, Nigeria where she has given training to missionaries there, counseling to teachers in schools and a personal counseling ministry to disadvantaged youth.

<b>Personal Message</b>
We truly appreciate both your prayer and financial support as we partner together to reach the nations for Christ. International Student Ministry is one of the most strategic ministries we have in sharing the gospel worldwide through its future leaders now being educated on North American campuses. Many of the international students we have ministered to here in North America have (and will) become the next generation of church leaders back home in their own countries and wherever they go. If you would like to partner with us in prayer and in giving or would like more information, please use the contact information below.
