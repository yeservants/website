<b>About</b>
I am blessed to have been following Christ for many years and am constantly amazed by His great love, grace, and mercy toward me. My Savior’s love compels me to serve Him joyfully through children’s ministry. It has been my privilege to serve children in the local church both in the United States and in Guatemala for the past 25 years. The Lord birthed a deep love for the people of Guatemala during a short ­term trip to Guatemala City in 1988. It has been my desire since that time to return as a full ­time missionary to the children in need there. I am thrilled to begin my long ­awaited journey of pursuing God’s call on my life by moving to Guatemala and serving the children of Latin America with the gifts He has entrusted to me for His glory.

<b>Ministry</b>
I will be serving Charlie's Lunch Ministries in their feeding centers and medical clinics. Charlie's Lunch seeks to meet both physical and spiritual needs by partnering with national churches and pastors to provide hot, nutritious meals alongside Biblical instruction,. In partnering with Charlie's Lunch, I will be traveling within Guatemala and to Honduras and El Salvador. I will also be using my Spanish, translating and medical skills to serve other Gospel ­centered ministries. A long term goal is to bring discipleship courses to national pastors, deacons and their wives through a church based theological training model.

<b>Personal Message</b>
Thank you so much for joining me in caring for the least of these (Matthew 25:31­40). Caring for their spiritual, physical, and emotional needs requires a willingness and sacrifice on our part. Please keep this ministry in your prayers as I depend on Christ to provide, protect, and use me to advance His Kingdom here on earth.
