<b>About</b>
We are Doug and Marilyn Stewart. We spent 51 years with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES). For 27 of those years we worked with IFES in Latin America (Bolivia, Argentina and Mexico), helping start groups of Christian students who would witness to their friends and grow as followers of Jesus. We spent 24 years with IVCF in the US, mainly devoting ourselves to pastoral care of IV staff and to spiritual formation. We now live in Wheaton, IL, and have been retired for two years. We still meet with others one to one for spiritual direction and mentor-ship. We have three daughters and four grandchildren.
