<b>About</b>
William and Chantell Burgess have been missionaries since 2001 and have been married for 19yrs.  They are both certified trainers of the Leadership Challenge Association, one of the world's most recognized leadership training development organizations. They have served as missionaries in Zambia, Southern Africa. While in Zambia, they worked with World Vision in rural villages doing humanitarian work, building schools, providing school materials for children, and helping provide clean water. They have also done mission work in Namibia, Africa, and Central America.

Currently they are in Belize, Central America. Unlike the frontier mission work they did in Zambia, Belize has a tremendous need for discipleship, leadership training and evangelism.  They are located in a very strategic place with distressed areas all around and they are right in the middle of them.  This gives them lots of opportunities for relational evangelism in the area..
