<b>About</b>
Ann has a heart for the Unreached Tibetan Buddhist peoples of the Himalayan Region. She is a single woman who first heard the call of God to full-time ministry in NYC in 2002. She had been training and serving for a little over a year when she heard the call to East Asia in 2006. 2006-2008 she began taking trips into East Asia. 2008 she moved there and served with YWAM for 3 years. In 2011, she attended a church planting training in Cape Town, South Africa and joined All Nations Family at that time. That is when she received vision and calling for the Tibetan Buddhist peoples of the Himalayas. She moved to North India in 2014 and has been there pioneering a new work among the Unreached since that time.
She is a lover of music and loves to use her voice in worship to the Creator God! She enjoys using musical worship for spiritual warfare, adoration, corporate worship, intercession, and personal times of soaking in the presence of the Father who inhabits the praises of His people!

<b>Ministry</b>
Ann works with an organization called All Nations Family in North India. Her work includes Evangelism and church planting among Tibetan Buddhists. She serves as the ANF team leader for that location and is also studying Tibetan language.
