                <b>Location:</b> Champaign-Urbana, IL

<b>Sending Church:</b> Redeemer Church
<b>Ministry Started:</b> June 2016
<b>Duration:</b> Full-Time

<b>About</b>
Jon was involved with Campus Outreach at Tennessee Tech University. In 2008, Jon moved to Central Illinois to join the Campus Outreach expansion staff team. There he met Cassie, who got involved with their ministry as a senior in college. In 2011, God graciously gave Jon a beautiful, amazing wife.  Cassie and Jon now have four precious children, ages 5, 4, 3, and 3 months.  Since they got married, they have been working with college students on campuses in Central Illinois. In 2016, Jon went off staff with Campus Outreach and became the campus minister of Redeemer Church, who had been praying for a full-time campus minister ever since planting the church in 2009.  The church is located by the massive and diverse campus of the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, IL.

<b>Ministry</b>
Redeemer Church desires to “bring the church to campus, and the campus to church.”  Jon and Cassie work to build friendships, share the Gospel, and establish and equip students as laborers in the harvest.  God has placed Jon and Cassie in a ministry home in a very strategic location, right across the street from campus and surrounded by Greek houses and students on all sides.  Jon has spent most of his time working with a fraternity and dorm by their home.  While Cassie has a different primary role, she supports Jon’s ministry, works hard taking care of the children at home, and ministers regularly to girls from the next door sorority.  Though they spend most of their time with undergraduate nationals, they also have been able to minister to various internationals, mainly from China and Indonesia.  The U of I is a strategic campus to potentially reach many nations. The U of I has the 2nd largest enrollment of international students among public institutions in the world, with around 115 different countries represented—What an opportunity!  The harvest in truly plentiful, but the laborers are few.  Please pray eagerly desire your prayers that the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest.

<b>Personal Message</b>
In Matthew 9:37-38, Jesus says, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore, pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” Please pray the Lord would do just that.  May our Lord save students, raise them up, and send them out as laborers into his harvest. Thank you for your prayers and support!
